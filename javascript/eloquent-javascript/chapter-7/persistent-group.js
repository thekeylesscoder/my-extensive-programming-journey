/* Make a PGroup class similar to one made in Chapter 6 with similar methods. An exception is that all methods method needs to return a copy with a new value while still retaining the original instances (i.e. add includes a new value; delete removes just the old value). This should work for any values, not only strings, and efficiency isn't the main purpose. It should include a constructor internally with an empty instance to begin. */
