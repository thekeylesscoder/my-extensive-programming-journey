// Make a webpage that shows a balloon emoji, ðŸŽˆ, that increases in size by 10% when pressing the up arrow, and decreases it the same amount. (A hint is given to use style.fontSize and to use a unit value to increase it by, such as em; and using the appropriate key names, "ArrowUp" and "ArrowDown" without moving the page itself. The emoji should change to ðŸ’¥ if it gets past a specified size (and can no longer use an event handler).
