// Make a tabbed interface through a function, asTabs, where the DOM nodes show children elements. The <button> elements need to be inserted at the node's top (for each child element) with the data tab-name attribute included. Everything except one child element should be hidden, while the visible node can be shown through button clicks. Style the button for the selected tab so the user can tell which one is active.
