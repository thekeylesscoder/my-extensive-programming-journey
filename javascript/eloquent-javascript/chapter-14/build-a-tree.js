// Make a program that takes the values from a data set, mountains, that makes a DOM structure that gives a column and row for each object and header rows. Columns should be automatically returning property names, and add an element with an id "mountains" so it's displayed and right-align specific values.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<table id="mountains">
  
</>
</html>
