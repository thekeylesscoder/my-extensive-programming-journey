/* Include shortcuts for keyboard keys to the web application, where the tool's first letter selects it, and CTRL or CMD of the same letter undos it.
This can be accomplished with the PixelEditor component, where the tabIndex 0 property can get focused by the keyboard. Consider key event handlers
with this exercise, and that events associated with the keyboard (ctrlKey and metaKey) can check if keys are being held.
