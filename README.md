# My Extensive Programming Journey
Referencing all programming book practices I've completed. Books are grouped by language rather than the fields they're traditionally used (such as web or software development) for ease of access. 

## Git

GitHub Doc's [Moving a file to a new location](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location)
MacWorld's [Master the macOS command line: How to navigate files and folders in Terminal](https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html)

## JavaScript

### [Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition](https://eloquentjavascript.net/3rd_edition/) by Marijn Haverbeke

#### Chapter 1

GateOverflow's ["The binary number 10011101 is equal to the hexadecimal number"](https://gateoverflow.in/45601/the-binary-number-10011101-is-equal-to-the-hexadecimal-number): Ensuring example calculation of 157 as a binary number was correct.
